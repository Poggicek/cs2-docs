:::info
As of the **3/30/2023** update a lot of commands received a devonly + defensive flag. You can use these commands only if you set `DefensiveConCommands` to **0** in `csgo_core/gameinfo.gi`.
Developmentonly commands without the defensive flag cannot be used even with `DefensiveConCommands "0"`
